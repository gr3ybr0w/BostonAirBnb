The libraries used:
The libaries used are all included with the latest version of anaconda this can be installed by visiting their website

The motivation for the project:
I have choosen this project as it is part of a course by Udacity. It is also a real interesting dataset and one of special
interst to be as I have recently started using airBnB.

The are three datasets in the data folder:
- Calendar: which shows when a listing is in use or avaiable and at what cost.
- Listings: this tells us information about the listed property.
- Reviews: This contains review data made by people that have stayed at a listing.

The notebook in this repo looks to anwser three question about the data that can be of use to AirBnB and those that use
their system. These questions are:
- When is it cheapest to visit Boston?
- Does the acceptability of a host change over time?
- And what features of a listing affect the price asked for?
